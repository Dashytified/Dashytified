<h3>Life as it is to whomever may think to be able to encapsulate life is implying none more than a pursuit of proclamation formed out of life itself. The source of all existence for as far as existence is existence to whomever existence is existence. The value of life is a given by life. Value is life. Life is value. Yea, read that twice. -Dash</h3>
